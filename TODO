By order of importance:

o Redesign fully the code: improve main-functions (dump & run-bench),
  improve definition of variables used for benches (maybe a collection class,
  with properties), add categories for benches (such as categories for images, ...)

o Have a good visibility with use-package (instead of in-package)

o Improve error management

o Update documentation in order to detail the time-info slots

o Add a Info-string which details the test, dumped with the results of the
  bench. Allow to add prologue/epilogue for dumps (will allow the automated
  creation of tabulars, stuff like that)

o Track sub-functions : sb-introspect::find-function-callees

o Decide about other compilers (include the profiler in the package)
  - This would also require a detailled analysis of the different profiler
    implementation, and if-possible, have an implementation with less overhead
