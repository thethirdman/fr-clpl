- Reformulate the functions dumping into the file (more clarity)
- Redefine time function, and maybe sb-profile:report to deconstruct more easily the results, and have some treatments on it.
- Get an option system  for the results : gc, overhead, etc ...
- Maybe profiling only necessary functions (when tracking subfunctions) would reduce the overhead, make a function to d othis.
- Improve error management
