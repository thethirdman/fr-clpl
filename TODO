o Fix Padding bug
o Have a good visibility with use-package (instead of in-package)
o Update documentation in order to detail the time-info slots
o Do an example file and some test files --> LaTex tabular example
o Add a Info-string which details the test, dumped with the results of the
  bench. Allow to add prologue/epilogue for dumps (will allow the automatical
  creation of tabulars, stuff like that)
o Improve error management
o Track sub-functions : sb-introspect::find-function-callees
o Autogenerate functions for inheriting class
o Define the generic functions -- Clean code
o Later : decide about other compilers
