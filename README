Common Lisp Profiling Library is a package supposed to provide many tools to do
profiling on projects. It's interface is inspired from lisp-unit, and CLPL aims
to be simple and efficient in analysing common lisp programs. The idea is to give
complete and detailed data about the program, allowing the programmer to analyse
this data and improve his project consequently. 
The project revolves around two parts : Scheduling of benchmarks, and
configuration of the output of the results.

Some parts of the code in this project belongs to the Steel bank common lisp
compiler. Don't hesite to buy them a beer if you find this is worth it.
